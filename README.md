Challenge Summary
this challenge is built class for animal-shelter

Challenge Description
this challenge is for implementing enqueue mthod for add only a dog or cat as in object in Animal class & delete them by using dequeue method where these methods should be created

Approach & Efficiency
this code challenge is simller to the previous code challenges, using the methods to create a enqueue and delete by using dequeue uusing any of data structure, i have used an arry structure.

Big O
enqueue()
time O (1) space O (1) time is a big O(1), because there is no while loop whatever the input given in the same time

dequeue()
time O (1) space O (1) time is a big O(1), because there is no while loop whatever the input given in the same time
