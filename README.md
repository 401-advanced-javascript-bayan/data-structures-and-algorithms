code challenge 6- ll-insertion

Challenge Summary 

Singly Linked List
create a linked list then create a method that do what supposed to do then test it .

Challenge
append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
Approach & Efficiency
append(value) Big O o(n)
insertBefore(value, newVal) Big O o(n-1)
insertAfter(value, newVal) Big O o(n)
