Challenge Summary
create a linked list then create a method that do what supposed to do then test it .

Challenge Description
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1).
