Challenge Summary 

we write two function the first one we have array of arrays we need to do the sumation of inner arr the secand one we do Fibonacci Sequence of any input

Approach & Efficiency I have issues in npm install and jest

Solution function 1 (sumation) write function call sumationmatrixe have input of arr of arrays looping through the outerarr and inner arr do the sumation push it in empty array

function 2 (Fibonaccisequence) write function have one parameter of integer value daclaring the first two values declaring the counter that will do Fibonacci do while loop do the equation for Fibonacci then return the value
