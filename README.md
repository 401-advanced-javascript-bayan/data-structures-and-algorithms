Trees
A binary tree is a special type of tree in which every node or vertex has either no child node or one child node or two child nodes. A binary tree is an important class of a tree data structure in which a node can have at most two children.
Challenge
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.
Approach & Efficiency
breadth-first() : traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.
