Use recursion to find the maximum sum in the left and right sub-trees.

Compute the maximum of the following four cases:

Value of root
Value of root + left sub-tree
Value of root + right sub-tree
Value of root + left + right sub-trees
If the maximum value (found in step 2) is greater than the global max variable, update the global maximum.

Return the maximum of the first three cases.
